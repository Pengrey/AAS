    "Fig.1 shows a sample email that contains a URL, an email address (at the end), numbers, and dollar amounts. While many emails contain similar types of entities (e.g., numbers, URLs, email addresses), the specific entities (e.g., the specific URL or specific dollar amount) will be different in almost every email. Therefore, one method often employed in processing emails is to “normalize\" these values, so that all URLs are treated the same, all numbers are treated the same, etc. For example, we will replace each URL in the email with the unique string “httpaddr\" to indicate that a URL was present. This has the effect of letting the spam classifier make a classification decision based on whether any URL was present, rather than whether a specific URL was present. This typically improves the performance of a spam classifier, since spammers often randomize the URLs, and thus the odds of seeing any particular URL again in a new piece of spam is very small. \n",
    "\n",
    "The words are also transformated into lower case letters and are reduced to their stemmed form. For example, “discount\", “discounts\", “discounted\" and “discounting\" are all replaced with “discount\". Sometimes, the Stemmer actually strips off additional characters from the end, so “include\", “includes\", ”included\", and “including\" are all replaced with “includ\".\n",

    "After the preprocessing we get a list of words for each email, as shown in Fig.2 for this example. \n",

    "The next step is to choose which words to use in the classiﬁer and which to leave out. The vocabulary list (file *vocab.txt*) was selected by choosing all words which occur at least a 100 times in the training set of emails (corpus), resulting in a list of 1899 words (Fig.3). Words that occur rarely in the training set were excluded, because they may cause the model to overﬁt the training set. In practice, a vocabulary list with about 10,000 to 50,000 words is often used. \n",
